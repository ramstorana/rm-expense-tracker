Audit

Visual & Functional Quality Gate (/audit)

Description: Performs an elite-level audit of the UI/UX and logic against the 2026 "Visual Excellence" and "Responsible App" standards.

Step 1: Environmental Check
- Open the integrated browser and navigate to the local development URL.
- Verify the build is stable and the Next.js 16 compiler has finished the initial render.

Step 2: Visual Excellence Audit
Analyze the current view against these non-negotiable standards:
1. Information Architecture (IA): Is the page organized by user goals? (Scannable in <3 seconds).
2. Modular Bento Grid: Is the layout structured in a clean, high-density grid? Check for consistent spacing tokens.
3. Glassmorphism: Are backdrop-blur and transparency effects applied consistently to cards and sidebars?
4. Typography: Is Kinetic Typography active? Ensure fonts are legible and reactive to interaction.
5. Sidebar Audit: Is the sidebar visually quiet? Grouped by intent, not features?

Step 3: Interaction & Trust Audit
Perform a "Stress Test" on the UX:
1. Immediate Feedback: Do all buttons and links acknowledge input instantly (<100ms)?
2. System States: Verify existence of:
- Loading: (Skeletons used during data fetch).
- Empty State: (Clear CTA when no data exists).
- Error State: (Recoverable, non-blaming messages).
- Success State: (Toast notifications for completed actions).
3. Optimistic UI: Do mutations update the UI immediately before the server responds?
4. Intent Check: Are Modals used for high-commitment/destructive tasks and Popovers for quick edits?

Step 4: The Audit Report
Output a report in the chat with the following structure:
- Squad Status -
- Visual Score: [1-10] -
- Functional Score: [1-10] -
- Trust Score: [1-10]
- Visual Wins - [List standout UI elements]
- Critical Fails (Immediate Fix Required) - [List any broken bento grids, navigation noise, or accessibility issues]
- Logic & Trust Bugs - [List broken endpoints, missing loading states, or ambiguous interactions]

Step 5: The Recursive Self-Correction Loop
Score Threshold: 9/10. - Action: If any category (Visual, Functional, Trust) scores below the threshold:
1. Diagnose: Analyze the "Critical Fails" and "Bugs" listed in Step 4.
2. Assign & Fix:
- If Visual < 9: Immediately assume the "Design Lead" persona and refactor the CSS/Layout.
- If Functional < 9: Immediately assume the "Builder" persona and fix the logic/API.
3. Validate: Re-run the /audit command automatically. - Exit Condition: Only stop when all scores are >= 9 OR after 3 failed healing attempts (at which point, escalate to the human in the Inbox with a "Blocked" status).

Step 6: Final Sync
Once satisfied (Score >= 9), update PLAN.md to "Verified & Polished." - Commit the working code to Git with the prefix: [AUTO-HEALED].
